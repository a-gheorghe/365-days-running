# 365-days-running

In progress project

Building a monthly calendar with <b>MomentJS</b> and <b>React</b> to track 365 days of running in 2018. 

End goal is to create a database that hosts running data and descriptions including photo of run, distance, comments, etc and connect it to the React front end in a calendar view.
